# Hand-Gesture-Mouse-Control
Hand Gesture Mouse Control using OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI 
This project implements a virtual mouse that can be controlled using hand gestures in real-time. It leverages MediaPipe for hand tracking and PyAutoGUI for system-level mouse control. The index fingertip (ID 8) is used to move the cursor, and a mouse click is triggered when the thumb (ID 4) comes close to it.

ðŸ§  How It Works
Captures video feed from webcam.

Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe Hands.

Extracts the positions of:

Index finger tip (landmark ID 8) â†’ to control mouse position.

Thumb tip (landmark ID 4) â†’ to detect click gesture.

Computes vertical distance between them.

If distance < threshold (30 pixels), it triggers a mouse click.

Draws:

Circles at key finger points.

Landmark connections.
